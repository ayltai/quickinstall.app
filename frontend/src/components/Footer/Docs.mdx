# How to use the footer

The footer helps users who reach the bottom of the page without finding what they want.

When using a footer,
* Always position it at the bottom of the page
* Provide links to the website's help sections
* Do not overwhelm users with too many links

# Guidelines

* Standalone links should start with a capital letter, and don't need a full stop.

# Default usage

<Primary />

# Parameters

<Controls sort='requiredFirst' />

<Stories
    title='Examples'
    includePrimary={false} />
