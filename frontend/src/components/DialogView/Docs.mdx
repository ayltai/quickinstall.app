# How to use dialogues

Dialogues are used to focus the user's attention on a single task or an important piece of information. They can be used to confirm a user decision, notify the user of important information, or when an immediate response is required from the user.

When using dialogues,
* Use them sparingly as they are disruptive to the user's experience
* Only give a single piece of information or require a single task to be completed. If you need the dialogue to do more than one thing, consider using a page instead

# Guidelines

* Include descriptive headings that include the main message of the dialogue
* Keep content concise
* When using buttons with dialogues, the button labels should make it easy to understand what will happen if the button is clicked
* It should be clear which button is confirmation and which is cancellation through button labels
