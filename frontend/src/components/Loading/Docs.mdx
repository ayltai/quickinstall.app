# How to use loading indicators

Loading indicators are used when retrieving data or performing actions that take a long time. Although they don't show detils about what is going on in the back-end, loading indicators reassure users that their action is being processed.

When using loading indicators,
* Show only one loading indicator on a page at one time
* Be consistent by using the same type of loading indicator for the same kind of activity
* Include a short visible label that clearly explains what is happening to the user
* Only use if the wait time is expected to be longer than a second

# Guidelines

* Accompany the loading indicator with a short label that explains the state of the process

# Default usage

<Primary />

# Parameters

<Controls sort='requiredFirst' />
