# How to use buttons

Buttons can be used in dialogue boxes, forms, cards or toolbars.

When using buttons,
* Use a button when users need to trigger an action on a page
* Use different button variants on the same page to direct user attention

# Guidelines
* Button labels should make it easy to understand what will happen if the button is clicked
* Lead with a strong, actionable verb paired with a noun
* Make sure the button label fits on one line
* Start with a capital letter and use sentence case, but don't add full stops
* Avoid using "my" or "your" in button labels
